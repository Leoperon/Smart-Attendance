# Smart-Attendance
Taking attendance of the class and managing it, is a time consuming job for a teacher. The objective of the your solution would be to make a teacher’s life easier in managing class attendance through a web or mobile app so that he or she can concentrate more on academic deliveries. Consider a hypothetical situation where a teacher will call the roles placing his mobile phone near his mouth and will record the entire roll call process. As the attending students’ response of the roll calls would not be recorded properly due to distance, hence the teacher will explicitly say “absent” loud and clear for the students who are not attending the class.    You are expected to come up with a Web or Mobile app which can 1.  Capture upload if needed) and process the attendance 2.  Generate attendance monitoring reports
